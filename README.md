## [Introduction to the Repository]()

Welcome to the "Basic Function Integrals" repository! This repository was created to provide an introduction to integral calculus through practical examples. Here, you will find detailed solutions to various integrals of polynomial, trigonometric, and logarithmic functions. This material is suitable for both beginners and those who want to review fundamental concepts of calculus.

This repository pertains to the Calculus II and Probability course of the Machine Learning discipline in the second semester of 2024 for the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence undergraduate program at the Pontifical Catholic University of S√£o Paulo (PUC-SP).

### [Solved Exercises]()
The exercises solved in this repository cover indefinite integrals and are presented with step-by-step solutions. Each example includes the original integral, decomposition into simpler terms (when applicable), the integration of each term, and the final answer.

## [Exercise List]()

Below are the exercises solved in this repository. They have been written in LaTeX to ensure a clear and precise presentation. Feel free to use and improve the code as needed.

### [Exercises: Find the following integrals]() ‚òü

### [Exercicise A:]() 

<br>

 $${\huge \bf \int \left(x^{\frac{3}{2}} + 2x + 1\right) \, dx}$$

<br>

- üí° [**Solution:**:]() We can integrate each term separately:

<br>

$$\huge \bf \int x^{\frac{3}{2}} \, dx + \int 2x \, dx + \int 1 \, dx$$

<br><br>

- [**1st:**]() ‚òû   $\huge \bf \int x^{\frac{3}{2}} dx$

 <br>

$$\huge \bf \frac{x^{\frac{3}{2} + 1}}{\frac{3}{2} + 1} \rightarrow \frac{x^{\frac{5}{2}}}{\frac{5}{2}} \rightarrow \frac{2}{5}x^{\frac{5}{2}}$$ 

<br><br>

- [**2st:**]()  ‚òû   $\huge \bf \int 2x dx\$

 <br>

 $$\huge \bf \frac{x^{1+1}}{1+1} \rightarrow 2 \cdot \frac{x^2}{2} \rightarrow x^2$$

<br><br>
 
- [**3st:**]()  ‚òû   $\huge \bf  \int 1 dx$ 

The indefinite integral of \(1\) with respect to \(x\) is given by:

 <br>

$$\huge \bf \int 1 \, dx \rightarrow x + k$$

 <br>

where \(C\) is the constant of integration. 

\int 1 \, dx = x + k

 <br> <br>

<br><br>

[**Final Result:**]() 

$$\large \bf \int \left(x^{\frac{3}{2}} + 2x + 1\right) \, dx  ‚ûû  \frac{2}{5}x^{\frac{5}{2}} + x^2 + x + C$$

 #
 
### [Exercicise B:]() 

$$\large \huge \bf \int \sqrt[3]{x^2} \, dx$$

### [Fundamental Concepts]()
This repository covers the basic concepts of integration, which is the process of finding the antiderivative of a function. Integration is an essential tool in calculus and is used to calculate areas under curves, volumes of solids of revolution, among other applications.
