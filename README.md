### [Introduction to the Repository]()

Welcome to the "Basic Function Integrals" repository! This repository was created to provide an introduction to integral calculus through practical examples. Here, you will find detailed solutions to various integrals of polynomial, trigonometric, and logarithmic functions. This material is suitable for both beginners and those who want to review fundamental concepts of calculus.

This repository pertains to the Calculus II and Probability course of the Machine Learning discipline in the second semester of 2024 for the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence undergraduate program at the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo (PUC-SP).

### [Solved Exercises]()
The exercises solved in this repository cover indefinite integrals and are presented with step-by-step solutions. Each example includes the original integral, decomposition into simpler terms (when applicable), the integration of each term, and the final answer.

### [Exercise List]()

Below are the exercises solved in this repository. They have been written in LaTeX to ensure a clear and precise presentation. Feel free to use and modify the code as needed.
